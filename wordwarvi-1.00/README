To build, just type "make"

You'll need portaudio (v 19, not 18)
(portaudio-devel rpm packages)
and libvorbisfile (vorbis-devel rpm package) to decode the 
included ogg files for sound to work.

See: http://www.portaudio.com/

To build without any sound support, type "make WITHAUDIO=no" 

If you want to hack on the code, read wordwarvi_hacking.html
